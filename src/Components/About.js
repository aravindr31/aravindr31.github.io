            Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on
            the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012
            when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out
            hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &
            CSS!

          <h4>
            Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
            advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
            student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
            accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
            Upstatement for a variety of clients.
